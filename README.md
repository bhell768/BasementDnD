# Basement RPG
This is the Basement RPG web application. It is a RPG campaign management tool. Currently under development will have character sheet creation, map editor and viewer, DM tools, messaging, and should integrate well whether players are remote or in person and just want some help with organization. 


This project used the Software Ateliers ASP.NET Core Vue Starter
# ASP.NET Core Vue Starter

The repository contains an ASP.&#8203;NET Core + Vue.js starter template. The template is created by Vue CLI 3.0 with a new plugin based architecture allowing developers to interactively scaffold a new project with just a one command.

Original article how to create the starter template is available [here](https://medium.com/software-ateliers/asp-net-core-vue-template-with-custom-configuration-using-cli-3-0-8288e18ae80b).
