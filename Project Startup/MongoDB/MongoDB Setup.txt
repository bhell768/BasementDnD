db.CoreRace.insertOne({'RaceName' : 'Dwarves', 
'ShortDescription' : 'Dwarves are a stoic but race, ensonced in cities carved from the hearts of mountains and fiercely determined to repel the depredations of savage races like orcs and goblins. More than any other race, the dwarves have acuired a reputation as dour and humorless craftsman of the earth. It could be said that dwarven history shapes the dark disposition of many dwarves, for they reside in high mountains and dangerous realms below the earth, constantly at war with giants, goblins, and other such horrors.',
'PhysicalDescription' : 'Dwarves are a short and stocky race, and stand about a foot shorter than most humans, with wide, compact bodies that account for their burly appearnance. Male and female dwarves pride themselves on the length of their hair, and men often decorate their beards with a variety of clasps and intricate brads. A clean-shavel male dwarf is a sure sign of madness, or worse--no one familiar with their race trusts a beardles dwarf.',
'Society' : 'The great distances between their mountain citadels account for many of the cultural differences that exist within dwarven society. Dispite these schisms, dwarves throughout the world are characterized by their love of stonework, their passon for stone and methal-based craftsmanship and architecture, and a fiecre hatred of giants, orcs, and goblinoids.',
'Relations' : 'Dwarves and orcs have long dwelt in proximity, theirs a history of violence as old as both their races. Dwarves generally distrust and shun half-orcs. They find halflings, elves, and gnomes to be too frail, flighty, or \u0022pretty\u0022 to be worthy of proper respect. It is humans that dwarves share the strongest link, for humans\u0027 industrious nature and hearty appetites come closest to matching those of the dwarven ideal.',
'AlignmentReligion' : 'Dwarves are driven by  honor and tradition, and while they are often satirized as standoffish, they have a strong sense of friendship and justice, and those who win their trust understand that, while they work hard, they play even harder--especially when good ale is involved. Most dwarves are lawful good. They prefer to worship deities whose tenets match these traits, and Torag is a favorite among dwarves, though Abadar and Gorum are common choices as well.',
'Adventurers' : 'Although dwarven adventurers are rare compared to humans, they can be found in most regions of the world. Dwarves often leave the confines of their redoubts to seek glory for their clans, to find wealth with which to enrich the fortress-home of their birth, or to reclaim fallen dwarven citidels from racial enimies. Dwarven warfare is often characterized by tunnel fighting and melee combat, and as such most dwarves tend toward classes such as fighters and barbarians.',

db.CoreRace.insertOne({'RaceName' : 'Elves', 
'ShortDescription' : 'The long-lived elves are children of the natural world, similar in many superficial ways to fey creatures, yet different as well. Elves value their privacy and traditions, and while they are often slow to make friends, at both the personal and national levels, once an outsider is accepted as a comrade, such alliances can last for generations. Elves have a curious attachment to their surroundings, perhaps as a result of their incredibly long lifespans or some deeper, more mystical reason. Elves who dwell in a region for long find themselves physically adapting to match their surroundings, most noticeably taking on coloration relecting the local enrionment. Those elves that spend their lives among the short-lived races, on the other hand, often develop a skewed perception of mortality and become morose, the result of watching wave after wave of companions age and die before their eyes.',
'PhysicalDescription' : 'Although generally taller than humans, elves possess a graceful, fragile physique that is accentuated by their long, pointed ears. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, and filled with large, vibrantly colored pupils. While elven clothing often plays off the beauty of the natural world, those elves that live in cities tend to bedeck themselves in the latest fashion.',
'Society' : 'Many elves feel a bond with nature and strive to live in harmony with the natural world. Most, however, find manipulating earth and stone to be distasteful, and prefer instead to indulge in the finer arts, with their inborn patience making them particularly suited to wizardry.',
'Relations' : 'Elves are prone to dismissing other races, writing them off as rash and impulsive, yet they are excellent judges of character. An elf might not want a dwarf neighbor, but would be the first to acknowledge that dwarf\u0027s skill at smithing. They regard gnomes as strange (and sometimes dangerous) curiosities, and halflings with a measure of pity, for these small folk seem to the elves to be adrift, without a traditional home. Elves are fascinated with humans, as evidenced by the number of half-elves in the world, even f they usually disown such offspring. They regard half-orcs with distrust and suspicion.',
'AlignmentReligion' : 'Elves are emotional and capricious, yet value kindness and beauty. Most elves are chaotic good. They prefer deities that share their love of the mystic qualities of the world--Desna and Nethys are particular favorites, the former for her wonder and love of the wild places, and the latter for his mastery of magic. Calistria is perhaps the most notorious of elven deities, for she represents elven ideals thaken to an extreme.',
'Adventurers' : 'Many elves embark on adventures out of a desire to explore the world, leaving their secluded forest realms to reclaim forgotten elven magic or search out lost kingdoms established millennia ago by their forefathers. For those raised among humans, the ephemeral and unfettered life of an adventurer holds natural appeal. Elves generally eschew melee because of their fraility, preferring instead to pursue classes such as wizards and rangers.',

    "ShortDescription" : "You can keep your balance while narrow or treacherous serfaces. You can also dive, flip, jump, and roll to avoid attacks and overcome obstacles.",
    "CheckDescription" : "You can use Acrobatics to move on narrow surfaces and uneven ground without falling. A successful check allows you to move at half speed across such surfaces--only one check is needed per round. Use the following table to determine the base DC, which is then modified by the Acrobatics skill modifiers. While you are using Acrobatics in this way, you are considered flat-footed and lose your Dexterity bonus to your AC (if any). If you take damage while using Acrobatics, you must immidiately make another Acrobatics check at the same DC to avoid falling or being knocked prone. \u00B6\u00F80\u00F8\u00B6\u0009In addition, you can move through a threatened square without provoking an attack of opportunity from an enemy by using Acrobatics. When moving in this way, you move at half speed. You can move at full speed by increasing the DC of the check by 10. You cannot use Acrobatics to move past foes if your speed is reduced due to carrying a medium or heavy load or wearing medium or heavy armor. If an ability allows you to move at full speed under such conditions, you can use Acrobatics to move past foes. You can use Acrobatics in this way while prone, but doing so requires a full-round action to move 5 feet, and the DC is increades by 5. If you attempt to move through an enemy's space and fail the check, you lose the move action and provoke an attack of opportunity. \u00B6\u00F81\u00F8\u00B6\u0009Finally, you can use the Acrobatics skill to make jumps or to soften a fall. The base DC to make a jump is equal to the distance to be crossed (if horizontal) or four times the height to be reached (if vertical). These DCs double if you do not have at least 10 feet of space to get a running start. The only Acrobatics modifiers that apply are those concerning the surface you are jumping from. If you fail this check by 4 or less, you can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save to grab hold of the other side after having missed the jump. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to make the jump and fall (or land prone, in the case of a vertical jump). Creatures with a base land speed above 30 feet receive a +4 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump for every 10 feet of their speed above 30 feet. Creatures with a base land speed below 30 feet receive a -4 racial penalty on Acrobatics checks made to jump for every 10 feet of their speed below 30 feet. No jump can allow you to exceed your maximum movement for the round. For a running jump, the result of your Acrobatics check indicates the distance traveled in the jump (and if the check fails, the distance at which you actually land and fall prone). Halve this result for a standing long jump to determine where you land.\u0009When you deliberately fall any distance, even as a result of a missed jump, a DC 15 Acrobatics skill check allows you to ignore the first 10 feet fallen, although you still end up prone if you take damage from a fall. See the falling rules for further details.\u00B6\u00F82\u00F8\u00B6\u00B6\u00F83\u00F8\u00B6\u0009Many conditions can affect your chances of success with Acrobatics checks.
